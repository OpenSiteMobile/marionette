Marionette Todo Example
=======================

This repository contains the files used in our BackboneJS/Marionette Todo app example and served by GitHub for our website http://opensitemobile.com/marionette. It of coarse does use our MobileSiteOS software. So please refer to https://opensitemobile.github.io/mobilesiteos to see our "demo" site and https://github.com/OpenSiteMobile/mobilesiteos to view the files.

Also, you should note that the base files are referenced by the "mobilesiteos" folder in index.html and debug.html. This was done for convenience here (https://github.com/OpenSiteMobile/marionette) and should not be considered a required installation practice.
